# Flaws

The remaining Bugs are that the server does not update the position or change the colour of other players.



## Game

The game is a simple version of avoid the ball. A small purple ball bounces around the screen and the player must avoid the ball and be the last remaining player alive to win. The ball is client side so the user will not be able to spawn while the ball is coliding with them.
